`num_lines.py`: Script created by OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-4)
when given the prompt: "Write a python script that prints
a text file so that each line starts with a line number."

`check_chain.py`: Script written by Mike Smith that verifies
no actor is repeated more than twice in a solution to the
_Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon_ parlor game.

`test_*.txt`: Test inputs for `check_chain.py`. Some of them
contain an error we expect `check_chain.py` to catch and one
contains no errors.

`balance_parentheses.py`: Script created by OpenAI's ChatGPT
(GPT-4) to answer a prompt that instructs it to complete a
string of parentheses so that the number of opening and closing
parentheses is balanced.

`remove_names.py`: Script created by OpenAI's ChatGPT
(GPT-4) to answer a prompt that instructs it to write a Python
function that removes the names from a line like "Carey Mulligan
and Joel Edgerton starred in The Great Gatsby".

`extract_actors.py`: Script created by OpenAI's ChatGPT
(GPT-4) that learned from a demonstration prompt to grab
actor names from a line like "Carey Mulligan and Joel
Edgerton starred in The Great Gatsby". It still doesn't
work for all the examples.
